A finance tracker app.

I'm making this so I can get some programming experience in many walks of code, as well as understand how github works.

If you're reading this, forgive me for whatever spaghetti you find yourself looking at.

**The end goals for this project are:**

1. User Authentication: A (hopefully) secure login system to protect user data.
2. Dashboard: Overview of current financial status, including total income, expenses, and savings.
3. Expense Tracking: Log the user's daily expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
4. Income Tracking: Log the user's various income sources (e.g., salary, freelance work, investments).
5. Budgeting: Set monthly budgets for different categories and track progress.
6. Reports and Insights: Generate reports on spending patterns and financial health (what a user spends the most on, whether they are saving enough to reach certain goals)
7. Savings Goals: Set and track progress towards savings goals (e.g., vacation, emergency fund).
8. Notifications: Reminders for bill payments and budget limits, so on and so forth.
